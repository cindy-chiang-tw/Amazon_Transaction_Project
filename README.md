# Amazon Consumer Behavior & Purchase Analysis

# Project Overview

This project analyzes consumer behavior and purchasing patterns using an Amazon dataset. By leveraging Malloy, we explore key insights such as revenue distribution, purchasing habits, and survey responses linked to consumer demographics. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can inform business strategies, marketing decisions, and customer engagement improvements.

# Why This Project is Important

Understanding how consumers interact with e-commerce platforms like Amazon is crucial for businesses and researchers. Our analysis provides insights into:

* Total Revenue by region

* Consumer spending behavior based on demographics

* Most Purchased Product Categories
  
* Total Purchase by region

* Top 10 Best-Selling Products by Quantity

These findings can help businesses tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer experience.

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Before running the analysis, we conducted the following data cleaning steps:

Handling Missing Values: Filtering missing values in key fields such as purchase price, quantity, and survey responses.

Standardizing Date Formats: Ensured consistency in Order Date format for time-series analysis.

Merging Datasets: Linked purchase and survey data using Survey ResponseID to enable cross-analysis.
